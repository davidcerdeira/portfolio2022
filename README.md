## Introduction
This is my first personal portfolio built using React and Tailwind CSS. It features a simple design with a pastel palette of colors. It supports multiple languages using the i18next framework and contains a fully functional contact form. It also features a cool left sidebar with social icons and the ability to quickly download my resume.
